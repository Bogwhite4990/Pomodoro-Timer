# Pomodoro Timer

A Pomodoro Timer application built using Python and Tkinter. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This application allows you to start and reset the Pomodoro Timer with a graphical user interface (GUI).
